      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p class="about-us-text">Agnitio Counseling was founded by former Texas public high school students, well-versed in today's competitive college application atmosphere, with a passionate focus on your student’s achievement. Our team is committed to empowering driven and talented young minds to optimize their potential by leveraging our proven experience in gaining admission to the Ivy League, various top 25 universities, and prestigious scholarship programs. Agnitio aims to guide hardworking and dedicated scholars and assist in crafting applications that elevate their journey towards admission into their dream institutions and programs. </p>
      <p class="about-us-text">Agnitio stands out from traditional college counseling programs by incorporating a modern and personalized approach with a team of students who were just in your shoes. We understand how anxiety-inducing and intimidating it can be to look ahead toward all the work that needs to be completed between now and your application deadlines, but with the guidance of our team it all becomes (a little) more bearable. With one-on-one guidance counseling and planning, a workload broken down into more centralized packages to be edited by our team, and various mentorship and oversight opportunities, Agnitio will be there for you!
      </p>
      <p class="about-us-text">
        With the first application cycle, Agnitio is offering a FREE counseling program for select students. We believe that every highly motivated student deserves a chance to reach their academic and professional goals, and our team is dedicated to providing invaluable guidance and support to improve accessibility into the nation’s most prestigious and well-suited universities.

    </h4>
        <p>Your personal statement is one of the most important elements to your college application. Because of its pivotal position in the holistic review of your application, the personal essay is emphasized by our program.
